# MyTranslatorApp
WPF Application in Visual Studio 2019
1) Created a cognitive service for Translator resource in Azure Portal and got the key from the subscription menu.
2) Used the key from the Azure service portal in to C# code in order to utilise the resource in my application.
3) Also used an API end point from the Microsoft Translator App version 3.0.
4) From the translation end point, also got to retrive the different kinds of language codes for my drop down combo boxes.
5) In this example, at the time of application running, the sample i'm using is to translate the text from English to French.
6) The application needs to be updated by checking all the language codes populating them in to drop down menus and check whether the translation is working perfectly or not!?
